          <p>
            My name is Chi-Luc and I am a Software Developer based in üìç
            Montreal, Canada. I‚Äôm currently a UX Designer Intern at Coveo.
          </p>
          <p>
            From helping businesses manage sales through Billmate, to making
            scheduling and journaling more accessible with Daylee, I‚Äôm always
            looking for ways to empower people by tackling interesting
            challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the last 3 years developing my problem solving and design
            skills as a Mechanical Engineering Student at Polytechnique
            Montreal. Driven by curiosity, I discovered the magic of web
            development and went on the path of self-study with the help of
            amazing mentors and online ressources.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, you can find me reading, weightlifting and solving
            problems through Jiu-Jitsu and bouldering.
